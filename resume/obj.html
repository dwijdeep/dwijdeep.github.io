  <h1>Objective of My Life</h1>
  <p>
       The objective of my life is to live a simple, ordinary but challenging life till my last breath. I would like to work in 
	   a competitve and skill harnessing environment where i could enhance and improve my skills more so that they could prosper. Even it would be helpful for me to learn by doing as well as seeing others because i beleive in inspiring other through my own way of work. I don't try to feel associated but always try to inspire everyone in my niche.
