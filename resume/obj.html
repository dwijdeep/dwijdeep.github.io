       The objective of my life is to live a simple, ordinary and challenging life. I would like to work in 
	   a competitive and skill harnessing environment where I could enhance and improve my skills more so that they could prosper further. I would get influenced and tries to influence others because of my own actions. I don't try to feel associated with anyone but always try to inspire others.
